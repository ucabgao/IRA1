Minesweeper
===========

JavaScript implementation of the classic game.

The `minesweeper.js` file contains the core implementation of Minesweeper.
This contains all the game logic, and is UI-agnostic.

Currently, a HTML5 Canvas user interface example is included and the game
can be played using this UI by opening `minesweeper.canvas.html` in a web
browser.
