The problem is that a file object was being treated as a string.  This seems like a classic example of a problem that a type system of the granularity and power of TypeScript should be able to detect!  This is a candidate for a deep dive.  No matter how I changed the signature of fs.readFileSync in node.d.ts, tsc never errored.,600.0
