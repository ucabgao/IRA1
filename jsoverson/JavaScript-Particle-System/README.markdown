JavaScript Particle System
====================

HTML5 Canvas Particle System with gravity fields
---------------------

*Current state of code performs poorly in Chrome!*

The old demo still runs fine. Some recent change in chrome has caused performance to plummet (though still works fine in Firefox and Safari)

[Old demo](http://jarrodoverson.com/static/demos/particleSystem/) - runs well everywhere

[Current demo](http://jsoverson.github.com/JavaScript-Particle-System/) - current chrome chokes [#1](https://github.com/jsoverson/JavaScript-Particle-System/issues/1)

Can programmatically set up a particle system for use in other
projects. The sandbox page is mostly for the whiz-bang factor and to
show off capabilities without any user investment.

***How to install locally***
----------------------------
To run the sandbox page on your local machine, it needs to run via a web server.
