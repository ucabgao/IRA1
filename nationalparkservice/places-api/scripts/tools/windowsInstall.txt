Install PostgreSQL:
http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
get the 64 bit version

Install PostGIS
http://postgis.net/windows_downloads
make sure it works with postgresql 9.3, and is 64 bit

Open pgadmin:
Create Two Databases:
(These can be named whatever you want, but they will need to be updated in the poi app config)
"poi_api"
"poi_pgs"

Set the owner to your main postgres account, leave all other defaults

Create the schema(s)
This is scripted for unix, but for windows we have to do it manually

Download this script:
https://raw.github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/master/db/structure.sql
Open the poi_api database in pgadmin
paste the structure.sql into a new sql query window

Find the 3 functions:
maptile_for_point
tile_for_point
xid_to_int4

Remove these, since they aren't supported in windows

Run the script (Press the Green > button that is called 'execute query')

Run the following command in the SQL window:
CREATE EXTENSION dblink;

Now it's time for all the custom functions....
Navigate to:
https://github.com/nationalparkservice/poi-api/tree/master/scripts/sql_scripts/api

Go through all the files in the order of: 'windows' 'sequence' 'type' 'view' 'func'
Copy each file into the PGADMIN window and run the scripts (tedious, I know)

Now you should have the API database all set up!
Next up is the querying / rendering database..
In PGADMIN close the poi_api db window (don't save changes)
then open the poi_pgs database, and a SQL window for it

Run the following commands in the SQL window:
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
CREATE EXTENSION hstore;

Download this script:
https://raw.github.com/openstreetmap/osmosis/master/package/script/pgsnapshot_schema_0.6.sql
Open poi_pgs in pgadmin
paste the pgsnapshot_schema_0.6.sql content into the sql window
Run the script (Press the Green > button that is called 'execute query')

Now it's time for all the custom functions....
Navigate to:
https://github.com/nationalparkservice/poi-api/tree/master/scripts/sql_scripts/pgs
Go through all the files in the order of: 'type' 'func' 'view' 
Note that this order is different from the API order
Copy each file into the PGADMIN window and run the scripts (tedious, I know)

Now the PGS db should be set up

DB Setup complete!

-----------------------
Node installation
-----------------------

Download the 64bit node.js installer from:
http://nodejs.org/download/
Note that the default windows installer is 32bit.

You can either save it or run it directly. If you save it, run it once the download completes.
I prefer to save it so you have a copy of the version you installed in case something doesn't work later on, but either way works.

Accept all defaults, unless you have reason not to

-------------------------
Git installation
-------------------------
You'll need git, since all of our packages are in git

Download the latest version of the offical git for windows from: http://windows.github.com/
Install the application
Once done, it should open up the welcome screen. If not, double click the new GitHub icon on the desktop.
Enter your git username and password and continue through the screens. Skip adding a local repository.

--------------------------------
Open up port for the application
--------------------------------
http://forums.techguy.org/general-security/942307-unblock-port-3000-a.html

------------
iD installation
------------
navigate to c:\poi-website\node_modules
and enter 'git clone https://github.com/nationalparkservice/places.git'

change the ip address to match the server name

--------------------------
poi application installation
---------------------------

Under the nationalparkservice repo, find poi-api and hit "clone"
Once the clone is done, right click the repository and select "Open in explorer"
copy the entire directory

Move to directory where you want to host the website from. (I created c:\poi-website)
create a directory under that called "node_modules" (I created c:\poi-website\node_modules)
Open that directory, and paste the cloned git project in there
Open the examples directory, select all and copy it all
move back to your project root directory (c:\poi-website) and paste those files
go back into the project directory and copy package.json and paste it in the project root directory

Open "Git Shell" from your desktop or start menu
Navigate to the director of the poi application (poi-website)
run the command "npn install"

There will be some errors about python not being found, but python is not required, so they can be ignored

For some reason, handlebars does not come with the windows package, so you need to manually add it
This may change in the future, but for now, enter:
nps install express3-handlebars

Copy the c:\poi-website\node_modules\poi-api\example.config.json file to 
c:\poi-website\node_modules\poi-api\config.json
Change the database username and password to the username and password you used to set up the database
the address is the address of the computer with postgis installed on it
the api and pgs entries are the names of the databases for the API and the pgsnapshot api
